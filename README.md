 I realized after watching the video again that I didn't do the priority quite the way it was intended; I have a "weight" with a priority value, and the tasks only change position if one weight eclipses another...
 
 Also, the last item cannot be removed, but that's on purpose. 
 
 Lastly, I didn't get to the errors (yet?)
