- syntax - watch semi-colons
- remove console.logs - it muddies the code
- add an npm start script
- add ability to connect to the database within the models class
- don't start server until you're connected to database
- naming-- myscript.js -- not very descriptiive
- no need to use .exec
- use restful routes -- use delete verb for deleting routes -posting to /taskdel is a bad request if you are deleting a resource
- angular.element(document.getElementById('hello')).scope().get() - I don't see the need for this.
- I don't think the sorting is working
- this concerns me quite a bit-- what are you trying to accomplish-- how could be passing throught the promise chain by calling angular.element
    $http.post('/down', task)
      .then(
        function(response) {
          console.log(response)
            //this part took me a long time to figure out!
          angular.element(document.getElementById('hello')).scope().get();
        },
        function(response) {
          console.log(response)
        }

      );
